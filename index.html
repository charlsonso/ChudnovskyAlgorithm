		<p> The Chudnovsky Brothers (born in Kiev) are American matehmaticians known for their world record mathematical calculations and developed this algorithm to calculate digits of pi in base 16 with extreme precision. This algorithmn is one of the fastest ways to calculate pi since the time complexity is O(n) and memory is O(nlog(n))<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_brothers">Source</a>
